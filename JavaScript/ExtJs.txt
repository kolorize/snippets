Core concepts:
model view controller forced
View components:
- border - has North, south, West, center region - typical web design, divided in to 5 pieces
- anchor - two params height and width could be in percents.
- absolut - just starting point x,y like desktop
- card tabs or wizard - just one child at the time
- column - will shrink
-fit - will fit to container
- table - not used to much is more like gr√≥d
//flex : 1 - show much will expand comparing to other flex configs
tips:
-panel nesting - avoid
-minimal layout
- could used docked items top tbar and bottom bbar instead of panel nesting
